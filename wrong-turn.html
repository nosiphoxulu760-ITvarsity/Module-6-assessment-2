                            <h3>WRONG TURN 7</h3>
    <p>A young woman is going with her friends to a cabin on a lake for a relaxing weekend
           after her sister's disappearance with no trace except for a lot of blood. But after her friends 
          start going missing, she meets the one who killed her sister.</p>
          <p> Aria Roberts (Kaley Cuoco) is screaming and running through the woods. 
                She stops and rests against a tree. An arrow flies in and hits right next to her hand,
                 scaring her as a cackle sounds through the woods. She runs to a building and starts banging
                  on the door and screaming for help. She turns around and gasps for air as the laughing and 
                  running behind her 
                stop. The door opens and her hair is pulled and she is dragged inside.</p>
